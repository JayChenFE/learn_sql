# 11、查询至少有一门课与学号为“1001”的同学所学相同的同学的学号和姓名；

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
        s.S# ,
        s.Sname
FROM    Student s
        JOIN Sc sc ON s.S# = sc.S#
WHERE   sc.C# IN ( SELECT DISTINCT
                            sc2.C#
                   FROM     Sc sc2
                   WHERE    sc2.S# = '001' )
ORDER BY s.S#;
```

# 12、查询至少学过学号为“001”同学所有一门课的其他同学学号和姓名； 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
        s.S# ,
        s.Sname
FROM    Student s
        JOIN Sc sc ON s.S# = sc.S#
WHERE   s.S# <> '001'
        AND sc.C# IN ( SELECT DISTINCT
                                sc2.C#
                       FROM     Sc sc2
                       WHERE    sc2.S# = '001' )
ORDER BY s.S#;
```



# 13、把“SC”表中“叶平”老师教的课的成绩都更改为此课程的平均成绩； 

```sql
UPDATE  sc
SET     Score = ( SELECT    AVG(score)
                  FROM      SC AS sc
                            JOIN Course AS c ON sc.C# = c.C#
                            JOIN Teacher AS t ON c.T# = t.T#
                  WHERE     t.Tname = '叶平'
                )
WHERE   C# IN ( SELECT DISTINCT
                        sc.C#
                FROM    sc
                        JOIN Course c ON sc.C# = c.C#
                        JOIN Teacher t ON c.T# = t.T#
                WHERE   t.Tname = '叶平' );
```



# 14、查询和“1002”号的同学学习的课程完全相同的其他同学学号和姓名；
