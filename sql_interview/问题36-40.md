# 36、查询任何一门课程成绩在70分以上的姓名、课程名称和分数； 

```sql
 SELECT DISTINCT
        s.S# ,
        s.Sname ,
        c.Cname ,
        sc.Score
 FROM   Student s ,
        SC sc ,
        Course c
 WHERE  s.S# = sc.S#
        AND sc.C# = c.C#
        AND sc.Score >= 70;
```



# 37、查询不及格的课程，并按课程号从大到小排列 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
        sc.C# ,
        c.Cname
FROM    SC sc ,
        Course c
WHERE   sc.C# = c.C#
        AND sc.Score < 60
ORDER BY sc.C# DESC;
```

# 38、查询课程编号为003且课程成绩在80分以上的学生的学号和姓名； 

```sql
SELECT  sc.S# ,
        s.Sname
FROM    Student AS s ,
        SC AS sc
WHERE   s.S# = sc.S#
        AND sc.C# = '003'
        AND sc.Score >= 80;
```

# 39、求选了课程的学生人数 

```sql
SELECT  COUNT(DISTINCT S#) AS 'StuCount'
FROM    SC;
```

# 40、查询选修“叶平”老师所授课程的学生中，成绩最高的学生姓名及其成绩 

```sql
SELECT  s.S# ,
        s.Sname ,
        sc.Score
FROM    Student AS s
        JOIN SC AS sc ON s.S# = sc.S#
        JOIN Course AS c ON sc.C# = c.C#
        JOIN Teacher AS t ON c.T# = t.T#
WHERE   t.Tname = '叶平'
        AND sc.Score = ( SELECT MAX(sc2.Score)
                         FROM   SC sc2
                         WHERE  sc.C# = sc2.C#
                       );
