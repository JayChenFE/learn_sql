# 26、查询每门课程被选修的学生数

```sql
SELECT  sc.C# ,
        MAX(c.Cname) AS 'CName' ,
        COUNT(DISTINCT sc.S#) AS 'StudentCount'
FROM    SC AS sc
        JOIN Course AS c ON sc.C# = c.C#
GROUP BY sc.C#;
```

 

# 27、查询出只选修了3门课程的全部学生的学号和姓名 

```sql
SELECT  s.S# ,
        s.Sname
FROM    Student AS s
WHERE   s.S# IN ( SELECT    sc.S#
                  FROM      SC AS sc
                  GROUP BY  sc.S#
                  HAVING    COUNT(DISTINCT sc.C#) = 3 );
```



# 28、查询男生、女生人数 

```sql
 SELECT COUNT(S#) AS 'BoysCount'
 FROM   Student AS s
 WHERE  s.Ssex = '男';

 SELECT COUNT(S#) AS 'GirlsCount'
 FROM   Student AS s
 WHERE  s.Ssex = '女';
```



# 29、查询姓“张”的学生名单 

```sql
SELECT  s.S# ,
        s.Sname
FROM    Student AS s
WHERE   s.Sname LIKE '张%';
```



# 30、查询同名同姓学生名单，并统计同名人数 

```sql
 SELECT s.Sname ,
        COUNT(Sname) AS 'SameCount'
 FROM   Student s
 GROUP BY s.Sname
 HAVING COUNT(Sname) > 1;
```
